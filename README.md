## Description
A new material representation (called volume element) is proposed to *describe* materials (hexagonal-BN and Si systems in this paper) for a training of neural network potentials and force feilds. Such represention uses geometric information of the target material system and is parameter efficient, as well as satisfiying electron counting model. In addition, an efficient reference data construction scheme is proposed to generate dataset with countinous and relative even populations by appling perturbations on ground-state configuration. Such perturbation-based scheme contains stable, meta-stable, and unstable configurations without bias.
